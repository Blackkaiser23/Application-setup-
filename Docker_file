# Define the command to run the application
# We use Gunicorn, a production-ready WSGI server, instead of Flask's built-in server.
# You would need to add 'gunicorn' to your requirements.txt for this.
# If you stick to flask's built-in server, use: CMD ["python", "backend.py"]

# Using Flask's built-in server for simplicity in this example
CMD ["python", "backend.py"]
